- Increase text size on Milty Draft widgets.
- Added "bag draft builder" configurable draft to tools bag (thanks Arinok + unknown original author).
- "Highlight Unit Upgrades" now draws lines correctly when unit stand is rotated.
- Prevent drawing more than 9 cards at a time from any deck.  If a player presses "1" then "1" again too quickly it will draw 11 vs 2.
- Flash screen edges when receiving a !whisper.
- Fix "all X faction" tool to include base game factions.
